   <h3>11. Birthday Game</h3>
    <p>Yatharth and Anamika are playing a game. Anamika loves Yatharth very much and she wants to share a chocolate bar with him in which each of the squares consists of an integer represented by 
        A
        [
        i
        ]
        . 
        
        She decides to share a contiguous segment of the chocolate bar selected such that the length of the segment matches Yatharth's birth month 
        M
         and the sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birthday 
        D
        . 
        
        You must determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.</p>

    <pre>
        function Birthday_Game(arr,D ,M) {
            let c = 0;
              for(let i=0;i<=(arr.length-M);i++){
                let sum= 0;
                  for(let j=0;j<=M;j++){
                  sum += arr[j+i];
                  }
                   if(sum===D){
                    c += 1;
            }
              }
              return c;
